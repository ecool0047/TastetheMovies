        <div id = "AboutUs">
            <h2> Eli Coolman</h2>
            <img id="Eli" src = "images/me.jpeg" alt = "Eli Coolman picture"/>
            <p> Eli Coolman is a freshman student at Purdue Universtiy majoring in Building Information Modeling. Throughout his life Eli has both had a passion for the culinary and cinematic arts. This constant passion for both food and movies are what led to his collboration with fellow co-founders Fabían Gomez and Dylan Grieger. The combination of these three movie and food eccentrics has led to their brainchild and this website- Taste the Movies. Although this is only Eli's first website, he plans to continue his career as a developer as he has a passion for working with computers.   </p>
            <h2> Fabian Gomez</h2>
            <img id="Fabian" src = "images/fabian.jpg" alt = "Fabian Gomez picture"/>
            <p> Fabian Gomez is a freshman in the exploratory program at Purdue University. During high school Fabian had an interest in coding but just regular coding never really interested him, until he got in a web development class during senior year. He found making websites way more fun than just coding things and watching it come out on a console. Now hes pursuing a possible career in web development, this website being one of his simple beginnings with the career.</p>
            <h2> Dylan Grieger </h2>
            <img id="Dylan" src = "images/dylan.jpg" alt = "Dylan Grieger picture"/>
            <p> Dylan is a freshman studying Data Visualization, passionate about turning complex data into clear, compelling stories. With a growing interest in design, coding, and analytics, he's exploring how visual tools can influence understanding and decision-making. As he builds his skills, Dylan aims to create impactful visuals that make information more accessible and engaging for everyone.</p>

        <div id = "MissionStatement">
            <h2 class="moviesH1"> <strong>Mission Statement</strong></h2>
            <p1> At Taste the Movies, we bring the silver screen straight to your stovetop. Our mission is to turn reel meals into real meals, helping fans everywhere taste the magic of their favorite movies — one iconic bite at a time. Whether it's ratatouille from Parisian kitchens, second breakfasts from Middle-earth, or a heartwarming pie from a small-town diner drama, we're here to serve cinematic cravings with a side of creativity.

                We believe every great film leaves more than just a visual impression — it whets the appetite, simmers in your memory, and sometimes, makes you ask, "Could I cook that?" That's where we come in. We curate, recreate, and reimagine dishes that have leapt off the screen and into the hearts of audiences, delivering recipes that are as flavorful as the films that inspired them.
                
                At Taste the Movies, food is the ultimate fan service. We stir nostalgia into every saucepan, fold plot into pastry, and pan-sear pure joy from the world's most beloved movie moments. From blockbusters to cult classics, we believe every dish tells a story — and we're here to make sure you can taste every chapter.
                
                We don't just serve recipes — we plate up memories, toast to characters, and whisk viewers away on edible adventures. With each cinematic recipe, we invite you to not just watch — but cook, savor, and live the story. Because if film is an art, and food is love, then we're in the business of serving both hot.
                
                Lights, camera, convection oven — let's get this bread.</p1>
